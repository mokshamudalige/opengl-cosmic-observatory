# opengl-cosmic-observatory
Cosmic Observatory is an interactive OpenGL experience combining 2D algorithms and 3D scenes. Bresenham lines draw constellation links, Midpoint circles form planets, and basic OpenGL lines shape the observatory grid. A textured 3D model anchors the scene as users explore a stylized cosmic space.
